## 🌍 ALX Travel App 0x00
This project is part of the ALX Backend Development Program. It’s a Django-based backend system for managing travel listings, bookings, and user reviews.

##🎯 Objective
Build the core models for a travel booking system.

Create serializers for API use with Django REST Framework.

Implement a custom management command (seed.py) to populate the database with mock data.

Generate interactive API documentation with Swagger and Redoc.

## 🔁 Seeding the Database
Use this command to insert sample listings into the database:

Edit
python manage.py seed
Sample listings include:

Each listing includes basic data like title, location, description, and price.

## ✅ Make sure you've run:

#python manage.py migrate
before seeding.

##🧪 API Serialization

ListingSerializer

BookingSerializer

(You can add ReviewSerializer if needed)
